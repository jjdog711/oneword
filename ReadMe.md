# 📝 OneWord Daily

**One word, once a day.**
A simple, intentional way to connect with yourself and others.

## ✨ Overview

OneWord Daily is a mindfulness and connection app where users share **one word per day** with friends. The experience is designed around ritual, reflection, and anticipation—not endless scrolling.

Each word becomes part of a shared rhythm, building meaning and emotional patterns over time.

## 🔑 Core Features

* **Daily Word Entry** – Choose a single word that captures your day, mood, or focus.
* **Reveal Mechanics** – Words can be revealed instantly, mutually (after both send), or on a schedule.
* **Personal Journal** – Track your past words in a private daily log.
* **Connections** – Send and receive words with friends in a chat-style view.
* **Notes & Favorites** – Add private notes or mark words that resonate with you.
* **Optional Premium**

  * Themes & personalization
  * Emotional analytics & trends
  * Unlock missed words
  * Export your word history

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
